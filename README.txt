DESCRIPTION:
Silicate_Feature_Analysis contains the library of IDL codes used for the analysis 
presented in "The Spitzer IRS Debris Disk Catalog: II. Silicate Feature Analysis."
The codes were developed by Tushar Mittal and adapted by Emil Christensen under the 
supervision of Christine Chen at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD.

To run the code, please begin by looking at main.pro
